# JsJs

JsJs is JavaScript event-based programming framework implemented as a "single file library" that provides simple, repeatable, augmentable application structure for organizing objects, data and data-related events.

### Core Features and Concepts

- Objects can be merged with overwrite
- Objects can extended like other languages (polymorphism)
- Objects can follow a standard event-based template and be applied to a global object
